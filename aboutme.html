      <p> Welcome to my Junior Year Portfolio. I am 16 years old in Marlboro High School and have always had a passion for coding and web design. Taking web design has helped me to discover that coding is an aspect in a career I want to pursue in the future. I have always had a love for technology even since I was younger and have always found it fascinating to me. Learn more about me and my journey below :) </p>

          <div><strong>Ever since I was little, I was always attached to the factors of technology. Whether it was from setting up my iPhone, to observing websites, to debugging a wifi problem in the house, it always fascinated me. However, it was not until later where I discovered my love for coding and having the ability to make a website that are similar to ones we use on the daily. I would never have thought that I would be capable to learn the skills and languages to create such websites, but I was wrong. As I have currently been going on the journey through the Web Design Pathway Program here at Marlboro High School, I have been amazed from left to right. I had discovered my new love and passion for learning and coding all at once and therefore led me to realize that this is something I would want to carry on for my future. Every new language and skill we learn is a new step towards being a professional.</strong></div>

          <li class="list-group-item"><strong>During the past year, I have started learning the basics of code such as a couple languages like HTML and CSS. I have learned how to work with both of these languages together and program a functioning websites. We learned about the basic tags and functions of code including attributes, pseudo-classes, etc. Moving further throughout last year I was able to get into the language of Bootstrap, giving myself the opportunity to be more creative and have an easier coding experience. Using these three languages together have helped me to create the most fascinating websites. Over my sophomore year, I was amazed at myself and what I was capable of doing and I am excited to see what this year brings for me through the second year of the program. I never would of thought that an individual like myself would be able to create such websites but it was all from the skills I have learned along the journey. Through the third year of the program, I am currently starting to get into the Javascript language, further enhancing my programming skills. </strong></li>
